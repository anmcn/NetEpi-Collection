 <h1>NetEpi demonstration LiveCD</h1>
  <p>	 
  <p>This CD contains a complete, fully functional demonstration version of NetEpi 
  Collection, a web-based application for epidemiological and 
  public health data collection and data management. The demonstration 
  version, which runs under Ubuntu Linux, boots directly from the CD 
  without needing to be installed on or oyherwise modify the hard drive of your
  computer. The LiveCD, which is based on the
  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>6.10 LiveCD, will boot on most
  modern personal computers and laptops 
  with at least 512MB of RAM (but not on Apple Mac computers at this stage).

  The CD also contains movies of both NetEpi Collection and NetEpi Analysis (see below)
  in use, as well as background and introductory documentation, and complete copies of 
  the end user and administrator manuals. These movies and documents can also be accessed
  directly from this demonstration LiveCD without re-booting your computer - see the links 
  below.

  <p>NetEpi Collection is a tool for securely collecting structured
  information about cases and contacts of communicable (and other)
  diseases through Web browsers and the Internet. New data collection
  forms can be designed and deployed quickly by epidemiologists, using
  a "point-and-click" interface, without the need for knowledge of or
  training in any programming language. Data can then be collected from
  users of the system, who can be located anywhere in Australia or the
  world, into a centralised database. All that is needed by users of the
  system is a relatively recent Web browser and an Internet connection
  ("NetEpi" is short for "Network-enabled Epidemiology"). In many
  respects, NetEpi Collection is like a Web-enabled version of the data
  entry facilities in the very popular Epi Info suite of programmes
  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
  and in the Danish EpiData project, which is available for several
  languages.</p>

  <h2>Data Persistence</h2>

  <p>By default, each time this CD is booted, it starts afresh and
  any changes that you might make are not preserved. It is, however,
  possible to retain your changes between boots using a USB drive or local
  hard drive. The persistance mechanism requires a specially formatted
  file to be placed in the top-level directory of a drive. The drive can
  be your local hard drive, although we recommend you use a USB Flash
  drive or hard drive. Network drives are not suitable.</p>

  <p>The file <b>persistence.zip</b> on this CD contains a pre-prepared
  empty persistence file that can store up to 200MB. Unpack this file
  to the top level directory of the drive you wish to use. Note that
  the file must be called <b>casper-rw</b> when unpacked.</p>

  <p>Once you have prepared the persistence file, you should boot the
  LiveCD and select the second option from the boot menu: <b>Persistent
  mode</b> (this must be selected every time you boot the LiveCD and
  wish to enable persistence). The LiveCD should now boot normally,
  but any changes you make will be stored to the persistence file. You
  should see these changes next time you boot in persistence mode.</p>

  <p><b>It is important that you shut down the LiveCD after use and
  before removing the persistence drive when persistence is enabled.</b>
  If you remove the persistence drive or turn the computer off without
  shutting down, data may be lost. </p>

  <p><b>To shut the LiveCD down, click on the red power icon that appears
  on the top right corner of the screen.</b></p>
