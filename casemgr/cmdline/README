Modules in this directory are NetEpi plug-ins that implement the netepi
command line command.

The script "app/cmdline.py" is installed into the system path, and is
responsible for setting the sys.path so that application modules can
be found. It then imports one of the "plug-ins" in this directory and
calls the plug-in module's main() function with the (modified) cmdline
arguments. The plug-in is then responsible for doing it's own setup and
command line parsing.  In most cases, the plug-ins will be minimal,
implemented as calls into the application modules, where the bulk of
the logic will be.

The driver script accepts (and suppresses) these arguments:

    -D                  Enable application "debug" mode
    -T                  Enable application "database trace" mode

Modules must support these arguments:

    -h, --help          Print module-specific usage

Modules may support these arguments:

    --csv               Write output in CSV format
    -n, --dry-run       Do not perform any actions; show what would be
                        performed
    -o, --outfile       Write output to specified file
    -q, --quiet         Run without generating unnecessary output
    -s, --syndrome      Use specified syndrome/case definition (pattern)
    -u, --username      Run with credentials of specified user (default to
                        'admin').
    -v, --verbose       Produce friendlier output (by default, output should
                        suit scripting).

Plug-ins should avoid using the above options for other purposes.
