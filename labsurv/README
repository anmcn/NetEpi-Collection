Weekly respiratory virus laboratory surveillance application
============================================================

This is a small, bespoke web application to assist in the collection of
weekly respiratory virus test data from participating laboratories in New
South Wales, Australia. As such,the application has limited flexibility,
and that which it does have requires editing of its python source files
(in particular, the labsurv/labsurv.py file to change the list of
labs, tests and diagnoses). However, we have included it in the NetEpi
Collection distribution in order to demonstrate how the infrastructure
used by NetEpi can also be used to rapidly create custom applications
for specific purposes. The application could be used as a template for
similar data collection use-cases (scenarios).

It also serves as a prototype for the possible future inclusion in
NetEpi of a more generalised facility to collect aggregate statistics
(as it stands, NetEpi Collection is strongly oriented towards collection
data on individual cases and contacts, not aggregate data).

Prerequisites and configuration options are a subset of those offered by
NetEpi Collection. Prerequisites are unix, apache, python, albatross,
mx Tools, PostgreSQL, pyPgSQL or ocpgdb. Configuration options include
appname, apptitle, dsn, cgi_dir, html_dir, and tracedb. Please refer to
the NetEpi Collection README for more details.

To create the database ("labsurv" and "www-data" can be changed to suit
your environment):

    createdb labsurv
    psql labsurv -f schema/schema.sql
    schema/chown www-data | psql labsurv
