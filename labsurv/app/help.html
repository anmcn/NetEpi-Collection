<h2>Introduction</h2>

For further information about or assistance with this web-based facility,
please contact the Senior Surveillance Officer - Respiratory Diseases in
the Communicable Diseases Branch (CDB) of NSW Department of Health.<p>

This facility replaces the previous paper- and fax-based system of
voluntary reporting of respiratory virus laboratory test results to
the Communicable Diseases Branch (CDB) of NSW Department of Health. During the winter
surveillance period (start and end dates of which will be advised by CDB), participating
laboratories should submit the requested information, on a weekly basis,
as soon as possible after the close of each week. For the purposes of this data
collection, weeks end at midnight on Fridays.<p>

The facility is accessible from the Internet, but access to it is
protected via a login name and password issued to each participating
laboratory. You should keep this login name and password safe - don't
email it around or display it on an Internet page. However, it is
acceptable to allow your web browser to remember the password to make
logging in each week easier and faster, and because the login name and
password is shared by all staff within a participating lab, it is acceptable to
write them down for reference. The passwords do not need to be changed
periodically, but if you would like the password changed (for example,
if you think it has been compromised or revealed to unauthorised parties),
please contact CDB.<p>

Please be aware that although each lab can only add or modify data
their own data, each lab can download export files which
contain all of the data submitted by all of the participating labs for that year.
The facility was set up this way because: a) we assumed that each 
participating lab would be interested in seeing respiratory virus activity 
as reported by other labs; and b) it was quicker and cheaper to do it this
way. Future versions of this facility may provide automated reports based
on the data collected by it.<p>

<h2>Submitting weekly data</h2>

To use the facility, enter the URL provided by CDB 
into your web browser (it may be convenient to bookmark the site to avoid having 
to re-type the address each week. You may see a message about an invalid 
certificate - ignore that message and proceed to access the web site regardless.<p>

You will be prompted for a username and password, which will also have been supplied to you
by CDB. Both the username and password are 
case-sensitive. If your web browser offers to remember the password for you, by all means
accept its offer.<p>

After logging in, the first page is displayed. Your lab will have been automatically 
selected, and you just need to select the date for the week for which you are about to enter or
edit data. The date defaults to the previous Friday, and the last eight Fridays are
given as options. When you have selected the appropriate date, click the <b>Next</b> button.<p>

If you have already entered data for the selected week, those previously entered data will be 
loaded and displayed - you can edit those data or complete the data entry process for that particular week. Otherwise blank
data entry forms will be displayed. After you complete data entry on each page, click the 
<b>Next</b> button to, perhaps unsurprisingly, proceed to the next page. Note that each time you click <b>Next</b> or 
<b>Previous</b>, any new or changed data on the page you are leaving will be automatically saved to the
database used by the facility. However, if you close your web browser or if your browser or computer crashes or there are
network interruptions before you have navigated to the next or previous page, then it is possible that data you have 
entered or edited on that page may not have been stored in the database. If such an event occurs, it is a good idea to 
check that the data you have entered has been saved.<p>

Each data entry page is fairly self-explanatory. Where counts are sought, only 
integers (whole numbers) can be entered. It is best to use the <b>Tab</b> key to move 
between fields, rather than the mouse. Pressing <b>Shift-Tab</b> will move backwards through the fields.<p>

On the influenza cases page, the first letter of each type of test, type of influenza 
and each sex can be typed in order to quickly select each one, rather than having to use the mouse.
In the age field, age should be entered in whole years. However, for infants, ages in the form 
4m or 4/12 (meaning four months), 3w or 3/52 (meaning 3 weeks) or 2d or 2/7 (meaning two days)
are also accepted. In the suburb field, if a valid suburb name is typed, its postcode should 
be automatically inserted. Spelling mistakes will prevent the postcode lookup from working
correctly (this may be improved in a future version).<p>

If you fill in all ten rows of cases, an additional page with an additional ten rows foor cases will automagically
appear (and so on - there is no limit to how many cases can be entered for each week).

On the fifth and final page, a summary of all the data entered for that week is shown. The <b>Print</b> 
button will send a copy of this to your printer. If you are happy with the data, click the <b>Submit</b>
button to mark it as complete and suitable for inclusion in reports. Note however that you can 
still edit and revise data for your lab from up to eight weeks previously. Also, even if you do not click the 
<b>Submit</b> button on teh final page, teh data you have entered will still have been stored in the database.
The <b>Submit</b> button merely flags the data for a particular week as complete and suitable for inclusion in reports
(although it can and should still be revised after submission, if necessary).<p>

To log out, simple close the browser window or browser tab in which you have been accessing the facility.<p>

<h2>Downloading data</h2>

Each participating lab is able to download all of the data submitted by all participating labs for that year. This 
facilitates analysis of the data by each lab, if they so choose. Future versions of the facility may offer 
automated online analysis and reporting of the data. To download the data, simply click on one of the 
<b>Download</b> buttons on the first page. Data will be downloaded as a CSV (comma-separated value) file, which can be 
opened in Microsoft Excel or other reporting or analysis software packages.
