# One gotchya worthy of note - we currently allow more than one primary key to
# be declared - although this will prevent us creating the offending table (it
# can still be done manually), updates and deletes will use the hybrid
# "primary" key to locate the correct column to be updated.
#
# Cyclic dependancies be here (table describers to db describers, column
# describers to table describers)!
