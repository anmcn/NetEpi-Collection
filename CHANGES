CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN NetEpi Collection
=======================================

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.4 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.7.2
=============================================================

This round of changes was funded by the Australian Government Department of
Health and Ageing.

* Added support for importing data to checkbox fields. When using the
  "Multivalue" column import, the data must appear in a single field with
  a delimiter character ("/" by default). Exports from NetEpi Collection
  already use this format.

* The admin form editor has been reimplemented, now relying heavily on
  Javascript for it's operation. In particular, a more powerful "cut
  and paste" mechanism for moving and duplicating inputs, questions and
  sections replaces the "move up", "move down", and "delete" buttons.
  Cut&paste between forms is also possible, as the cut buffer is retained
  between invocations of the form editor.

* The admin interface for editing address "states" and "assignments",
  and the form editor checkbox and droplist choices now use client-side
  scripting allow reordering of the options without requiring a round-trip
  to the server (as the former "up" and "down" buttons did).


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.6.0
=============================================================

This round of changes was funded by the Australian Government Department of
Health and Ageing. The changes focused on improvements to reporting system:

* A new "reports" menu has been introduced, making it easier to browse
  saved reports.

* Report filtering now supports logical conjunctions and disjunctions (AND and
  OR).

* There are now four levels of report sharing: "quick" (shown on home page),
  "public" (available to all users), "role" (available to everyone in your
  role) and "private" (available only to you).

* A new "PUBREP" right has been introduced that allows users to run reports
  that have been shared with them, without giving them full access to the
  reporting system.

* The graphical reports, "Epi curve" and "Association Visualisation" are
  now report types in their own right, rather than being a sub-function of
  line reports.

* Reports are now saved in XML format (rather than as Python pickles), and
  reports can now be imported and exported, facilitating sharing of reports
  and improving the robustness of saved reports.

* Line report output can now be generated in CSV format (similar to the
  record export function, but allows filtering and control over the columns
  exported).

* Cross-tab reports now accept a third "page" axis, as well as options to
  suppress empty rows, columns and pages.

* Epi Curve (time series) reports now accept categorical form fields as
  conditioning columns, as well as the core demographic fields, and the
  generation of tick-marks on the time axis has been improved considerably.

* Reports can now be run from the command-line utility.

In addition to the reporting enhancements, the "date-of-birth/age" demographic
field logic has been reimplemented to record the precision of the entered age,
improving the handling of ages in days, weeks and months.

These changes required changes to the database schema. The installer performs
the necessary upgrades. As a result, it is not possible to downgrade from
1.7 to 1.6.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.5.2
=============================================================
* The "home" page has been redesigned to reduce clutter while providing
  direct access to things like "recent cases" and the "quick search"
  function. 
  
  NOTE: As this required extensive use of Javascript, browsers without
  Javascript are no longer supported.

* Minor improvements to usability of the case and person merging have been
  made. 

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.5.1
=============================================================

* Add support to crosstabs for filtering by a form that is not a row or column.

* Fixed inconsistent handling of form fields with a maximum length of 0 (this
  now means "unlimited").

* Changed wiki links to always pop in a new window (otherwise we lose
  the application state).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.5.0
=============================================================

* The demographic field "tabs" on the case and search screens have been
  replaced by client-side dynamic HTML "folds".

* The data import machinery has been reworked to improve its handling and
  reporting of import errors, and test coverage of the import logic has been
  improved considerably.

* The unit test driver has been reimplemented to simplify the setup of test
  cases and suites, and to allow a single scratch database instance to be
  shared between all test cases. Previously, the scratch database was created
  and destroyed for each test case, which was slow and expensive.

* It is now possible to list and export form definitions via the command line
  interface.

* Made a number of improvements to the wording of messages within the
  application, and made other cosmetic changes, such as highlighting the field
  labels in the search result screen.

* A number of regressions that were preventing use with Python 2.3 were fixed,
  as were a number of other minor bugs. Also, when adding a new case, the
  results were incorrectly being restricted to the current case definition.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.4.6
=============================================================

* An extensive reworking of the contacts-to-case association mechanism has been
  undertaken. Up until v1.5.0, an association between a contact of a case and a
  case could only be recorded through the case record, and each contact record
  could only be associated with a single case (although each person could have
  multiple contact records, each associated with a different case). All of this
  was overly restrictive and potentially rather confusing, and many end users
  inadvertently entered contacts-of-cases around the wrong way. To address
  these problems, NetEpi now allows arbitrary, bi-directional associations
  between cases to be captured. In addition, such associations can now be
  captured between cases of any case definition (syndrome) type to which the
  user has access - contact associations are no longer restricted purely to
  pre-defined and specific "contact" definitions.  Furthermore, a type of
  association (or a type of relationship) can now be specified when recording
  associations between cases, with the type chosen from a pre-defined list. New
  association types can be added to this list on-the-fly by end users. An
  association date can also be recorded. Also, associations can be added for
  many records at a time, in a single operation, rather than tediously for
  individual records one-by-one. This is a particularly useful feature when
  used in conjunction with the new record tagging and case sets facilities
  described below.

* A case tagging facility has been added. During the public health response to
  influenza A H1N1 09 (human swine flu) in NSW, Australia in April-August 2009,
  we relabelled the "Facsimile (fax) number" field in the demographic fields
  section of NetEpi as "Tags" and used it to record short codes (such as 'PD1')
  to tag (or flag) records as belonging to a particular group, such as
  passengers on a particular cruise ship who were potentially exposed to
  influenza A H1N1 09 virus. This was found to be a very useful feature, but
  the use of purely free text tags was somewhat problematic. The tagging
  facility introduced in v1.5 corrects these problems: short tags can be
  quickly entered as free text in a new "tags" field, which is associated with
  each case record, not the person record to which the case relates. However,
  these free text tags are validated against a list of pre-defined tags to
  avoid typographic errors. Alternatively, tags may be chosen from a list. End
  users may add new tags, together with a short description or scope note for
  each tag, as they are required - intervention by an administrator is not
  required to define new tags. The tags field can thus be used to record
  membership of arbitrary groups, such as cases with exposure to putative or
  potential sources of infection or environmental contaminant. Each case record
  can have more than one tag applied to it. The label for the Tags field can be
  over-ridden for each case definition eg it can be relabelled "Exposures".
  Records with particular tags can be located using the search facilities, and
  can easily be converted into case sets (see below). Tags can also be used in
  filters for line reports and cross-tabs (and forthcoming in v1.6, to filter
  data exports as well).

* A "case set" facility has been added. This allows arbitrary sets of records
  to be browsed or edited as a set of records. Case sets can be temporary, 
  lasting only for the duration of a login session, or they can be given
  names and saved for future reference. Case sets can be created by selecting 
  some or all of the records returned by a search made through the search page.
  Case sets can also be used to add associations (contacts) to a case, or can
  be formed from all the associations for a case. Saved case sets can be
  renamed, deleted or sorted in different ways. In v1.5.0, individual records
  can be added to or removed from a case set once it has been created. Future
  versions shall also allow case sets to be merged and to be used with the
  tasking subsystem, and shall provide other ways of creating case sets, such
  as automatically updated case sets of all records which do not meet a 
  user-defined set of quality assurance or completeness criteria.

* A new DATAMGR (data manager) right has been added, which allows users who
  have been assigned this right to carry out duplicate person and duplicate
  case scans and to merge duplicate person and/or case records (and data
  forms). Prior to v1.5.0, only users with full administrator rights could
  undertake scans for and merging of duplicate records. This was found to be
  inconvenient in practice, particularly during an emergency, when
  administrators tended to be rather busy with other tasks.

* Further enhancements have been made to the person duplicate detection sub-
  system. There are two options: a full duplicate scan and a quick scan. The 
  full scan now compares every person record with every other person record, 
  but due to optimisations this exhaustive comparison is faster than previous
  partial (indexed) comparisons. The quick scan compares records that have been
  edited since the last duplicate scan with all other records - in other words,
  it is an incremental scan. Both the full and quick scans run in the back-
  ground, and changes have been made to prevent manual person merging while 
  background duplicate scans are running, and to prevent more than one 
  duplicate scan from running at once.

* A batch duplicate scan script has also been provided in the casemgr/cmdline
  directory of the distribution. This can be run as an automated "cron" job
  to scan for person duplicates on a regular basis eg overnight, or every hour.
  The results of the scan are stored and are then immediately available to 
  users who have the necessary rights [ADMIN or DATAMGR] to undertake person
  merging.

* A facility to scan for duplicate cases has been added (under the Tools menu,
  users who have the necessary rights [ADMIN or DATAMGR]). The scan is
  performed interactively (it runs quickly) for specific case definitions
  (syndromes), rather than all case definitions, because not all case
  definitions are singleton i.e. it may be acceptable, or expected, that a
  person will have more than one case of a particular type. Thus the facility
  should only be used to scan for duplicate cases where each person is expected
  to have only one case. The intention is to enhance this facility in future
  versions to allow detection of duplicate cases within a given temporal
  window.

* When cases are merged, the redundant case is now logically deleted, and a
  note is automatically added to it which points to the case ID into which it
  has been merged. Furthermore, when a search for a case ID is made using the
  "quick search" field on the search page, the case IDs of deleted cases are
  also searched. This helps prevent dismay amongst users who search for a case
  ID which they knew existed but can no longer be found, because it has been
  merged with another case.

* A new user invitation and sponsorship system has been introduced. Previously,
  new users wishing to apply for a user account could access the login page and
  click on the "Apply for a user account" button without any form of
  authentication.  This scheme was potentially vulnerable to imposters applying
  for accounts, and thus required very careful and potentially very
  time-consuming validation by administrators of the bona fides of account
  applicants. This scheme is still the default, but additional account
  application schemes are now available, which can be specified at installation
  time and/or later by a system administrator. A new "invite" mode allows users
  who have been given the new SPONSOR ("Sponsor new users") right to invite new
  users to register for a user account by entering their email address. A
  message which contains a random, one-time-use passcode is then sent to the
  invited person's email address.  The invitee is prompted to provide this
  one-time passcode before they are allowed to proceed with applying for an
  account. After they have completed their account application, their details
  must still be validated and approved by an administrator. The other new mode,
  "sponsor", works in a similar fashion but both the ability to issue
  invitations to apply for new user accounts and the ability to approve the
  account applications for which they have issued invitations is devolved to
  users who have been given the SPONSOR right. This mode completely avoids the
  reliance on a small number of administrators to approval all new accounts,
  while simultaneously dramatically reducing the likelihood of false account
  applications by imposters. All account invitations and sponsorships are
  logged in the central audit trail facility, and administrators or other
  nominated users can be informed by email of any new invited or sponsored
  account applications or approvals.

* Improvements were made to the way in which passwords were encrypted, and the
  requirements for password complexity were strengthened. Passwords must now be
  a minimum of 6 characters long and be a mixture of upper and lower case
  letters and numbers, and upper case letters and numbers must appear in the
  body of the password, not just as the first and/or last characters.

* A customised Apache web server authentication module, based on
  mod_auth_pgsql, is included in the tools/ subdirectory. When installed and
  configured, this module allows authenticated access to web content managed
  outside of the NetEpi application using the same usernames and passwords that
  are used to log in to NetEpi itself. This is useful for providing
  password-protected access to reports or other content, such as maps,
  generated by an external process based on data automatically exported from
  NetEpi, without having to manage or issue additional passwords to users.

* A "case assignment" field was added to the core demographic fields to capture
  which organisational unit (eg which Public Health Unit, or which juris-
  dictional unit) each case has been assigned to (if any). This often differs
  from the geographical region of residence or employment of each case. The
  valid values for this field can be specified by administrators for each case
  definition/ syndrome.

* A "recently accessed cases" pull-down list was added to the home page. This
  list provides direct access, without having to go through a search page, to
  the 16 cases which the user has most recently accessed or edited or added. It
  is somewhat akin to the "history" function in most web browsers.

* Improvements were made to the ergonomics of searching via the search page:
  pressing Enter after filling in the Quick Search field now executes the
  search immediately; the use of a wildcard character (*) in a search field now
  automatically disables phonetic searching; and if a search returns only one
  result, the user is shown that case record directly rather than an inter-
  mediate search results page with just one row on it. This last feature is
  optional, controlled by a configuration option which system administrators
  can set.

* It is now possible to embed the following strings in report and cross-tab 
  headers, pre-ambles and footers and have the corresponding information
  substituted when the report or cross-tab is run: {{date}}, {{datetime}},
  {{username}}, {{fullname}}, {{syndrome_name}}, {{syndrome_label}}.

* Data collection forms deletions are now logical, rather than absolute, and
  thus deleted forms can still be viewed (but not edited), and can be undeleted
  if required.

* Several minor bugs which manifest themselves in obscure circumstances have
  been fixed.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.6 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.4.5
======================================================================

* Significant enhancements to the person duplicate detection facility and the
  associated interactive person/case/form merging machinery. In particular,
  an "only changed persons" optimisation for the duplicate person scanning
  was added which makes incremental scanning much, much faster. In addition,
  if an excessive number of matches occur while duplicate scanning, the
  match cut-off is temporarily increased (otherwise up to persons^2 matches
  can be recorded!). The minimum cut-off was also set at 55%.

* Changes to search page appearance to more clearly distinguish the
  "general" (lookup) search page from the search page used when adding
  a new case or contact.

* Added a record count to the footer of printed line reports.

* Added the ability to capture a short textual reason for the deletion of
  case and contact records.

* Added a new class of message to users: "warning" (orange), in addition
  to existing "info" (green) and "error" (red) message classes.

* In the admin module, if searches for users, roles, forms etc return
  only one result, jump straight to the relevant edit page.

* Addition of a command-line tool to extract address details for all
  new and changed records and print them to stdout or a CSV file, from
  where they can be submitted to a geocoder for incremental geocoding
  (see the cmdline/ directory).

* Addition of a simple script to generate a description of the columns in
  an exported CSV file - this is particularly useful for providing some
  machine-readable metadata for data exported via the command-line/cron
  job batch export facility. See the tools/ directory.

* Addition of more last update timestamps on various entities.

* Minor bug fixes, minor cosmetic and/or semantic adjustments to labels and 
  messages, and some minor performance improvements.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.5 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.4.3
======================================================================

* A cross-tabulation report type has been implemented. Counts of cases, 
  contacts and forms can be readily generated. Clicking on a cell in the
  resulting cross-tab generates a query for cases or contacts matching the row
  and column criteria, and the resulting record set can then be stepped through
  in the case or contact edit pages.

* An additional check has been added when a user saves a singleton form to
  ensure another user has not already created an instance of the singleton
  form. If this has occurred, the forms are merged and the second user is
  warned to review the data before re-saving it.

* A rights-based user viewer has been added to the Admin interface, allowing
  administrators to rapidly determine which users have a given Right
  (permission), and how they acquired the right (via Context, Role or
  directly).

* In the form editor, you can now show the differences between the current 
  form definition and the deployed form definition (this functionality requires
  python 2.4 or greater. When an attempt is made to use it with python 2.3 a
  harmless exception will occur).

* A bug that resulted in spurious and transient validation errors occasionally 
  being displayed when first opening a form has been fixed. The problem was
  only evident when persistent application servers were in use (for example,
  FastCGI), and did not cause any problems (it has been present for several
  years and no-one has reported it), but it did cause occasional
  head-scratching when strange validation errors would sometimes appear when
  opening a new, blank data collection form.

* The schema upgrade logic used an incorrect default when creating the 
  DOB_is_approx column. This only effected databases that existed prior to May
  2006. The consequences of this error were that the date of birth would be
  treated as approximate even when an exact date of birth was supplied. For
  effected systems, the default for DOB_is_approx was incorrectly specified as
  TRUE. It will be necessary to manually fix effected schemas via psql and the
  following command:

    ALTER TABLE persons ALTER COLUMN DOB_is_approx SET DEFAULT FALSE

* When deployed with the "ocpgdb" DB-API module (rather than pyPgSQL), a bug in
  PostgreSQL was exposed that allowed invalid times to be saved to the database
  when using the "Time" form input. This subsequently caused failures when
  attempting to restore database dumps, as well as other problems with the
  data.  Additional checks have been added to the application and the bug has
  been reported to the PostgreSQL developers.

* The handling of report filters where the filter was filtering on
  form date/times has been fixed.

* The report system's handling of changes to form definitions has been improved:
  after form upgrades, (green) advisory warnings to check the validity of
  report parameters are still given until report specifications are re-saved,
  but reports now continue to function. Previously reports refused to run after
  form upgrades until their parameters were checked by loading them and
  re-saving them. Although this is good practice, the requirement was a bit too
  strict.

* Several changes have been made to the CSV data export functions to assist in
  scripted and interactive (via the web interface) exporting. These include:

   * A new row-per-form export style has been added to complement the existing 
     row-per-case export styles. This is more natural for certain types of
     analysis, and helps avoid problems when exporting into Excel (which does
     not cope with spreadsheets with more than 256 columns).

   * A flag has been added to optionally make the exporter remove newlines and
     other control characters embedded within CSV fields.
    
   * Command line exports now use the "write to temporary file and rename into
     place" pattern to avoid potential race conditions when other systems read
     an export file that is currently being updated.
  
   * A bug in the command line exporter's handling of the "export deleted 
     cases" flags was fixed.

* A logic error in task-based contact access control has been fixed.

* Two issues relating to the handling of RadioButton and DropList form inputs 
  with null keys have been fixed (these mainly effected the Countries and
  Languages input classes).

* An issue when importing an XML form definition into the form editor has been
  fixed. After an import, the form definition was not being marked as having
  been changed and consequently the "Save" button was not available.

* An issue that resulted in clients who were using systems such as Microsoft 
  SharePoint producing harmless but annoying exceptions on the server each
  time they logged in has been fixed.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.3 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.4.0
======================================================================

* A regression in handling of RadioButton and DropList form inputs has been
  fixed.

* A race condition when rolling out changes to a form definition has been
  fixed: if a user started filling in a form but had not saved it, the form
  would be saved with the old form definition. The application now checks the
  form definition version when saving the user's form and attempts to upgrade
  it to the newly deployed version (and warns the user that this has occurred).

* Fixed date/time handling in data import. For date/time fields, the date and
  time specification was ambiguous as MM was used to represent both months and
  minutes. The time format must now be specified in lower case (for example,
  hh:mm:ss). Additionally, a logic error that resulted in an application
  exception when previewing date/time fields has been fixed.

* The third-party library responsible for translating wiki-style markup was
  initialising the logging system on each call. When the application was
  deployed as a persistent application server (via FastCGI or similar), the
  application would slow down noticeably over a period of hours due to this
  misuse of the logging module. The logging logic has been removed from the
  wiki markup library.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.3.0
======================================================================

User database
-------------

* Groups and Units have been generalised into Contexts and Roles. Contexts
  allow a single instance to present different "faces" to different users
  concurrently, while still sharing a single user database. 
  
* When a user is a member of multiple Roles, they are able to switch Roles 
  via a pull-down menu on the main application page, and this choice is
  remembered between logins.

* Rights can now be associated with Roles as well as Users and Contexts
  (formerly Groups). A user's rights are the union of their Role rights, their
  Context rights, and their explicit user rights.  

* User data has been expanded to allow the user database to be used as a
  contact database. A simple user browser has been added under Tools, and users
  can control the visibility of their details in the browser via their privacy
  preferences. At login, users are periodically prompted to review their
  contact details for correctness. The periodical reminders are controlled by
  the user_check_interval configuration option.

  The user browser can be disabled via the user_browser configuration option
  (see the Installation section in the README file for more information).

* A new access model that allows users to see all cases and contacts associated
  with the case definitions assigned to their Role (rather than their Roles
  cases and contacts) has been added.  This access is controlled by the "Access
  by case/contact definition" right, which can be assigned to Users, Roles or
  Contexts.

* Disabled users (or users waiting for their account to be enabled) can now
  update their contact details.

* Administrators can now view the system log via the web interface. The system
  log contains information about administrative changes, such as changes to
  users, roles, contexts, case definitions, etc.

Data import
-----------

* It is now possible to import form data as well as demographic data.

* Conflicts encountered while importing cases or contacts can now optionally be
  resolved by temporarily creating duplicate records, and then resolving the
  duplicates via the duplicate person merging logic. A switch has been added to
  the data import parameters to allow users to choose between ignoring
  conflicting records or creating duplicate persons and cases. A new "View
  import conflicts" option has been added for Admin users under Tools.

Reports
-------

* Clicking on a row in report now takes you to the relevant case,
  contact or form.

* A shortcut has been added to the main page to allow reports with "Role" or
  "Public" sharing to be run directly.


Other changes
-------------

* It is now possible to create "Note" tasks that are not associated with any 
  case or contact.

* A (per instance) command line interface has been added to allow scripts to 
  interact with the application. In particular, this allows scripted export of
  data from an instance for analysis and reporting in other systems.

* The duplicate person search is now configurable - in particular, the
  inclusion and weighting of person demographic fields can be controlled, and
  the user can choose between trigram or bigram matching.

* Several other minor cosmetic and layout improvements have been made.

* Several bug fixes and some refactoring to improve the robustness and 
  maintainability of the program code. Many minor bugs in the notification
  system have been fixed, although the effect of these will only be apparent if
  a persistent application deployment model is used (for example, FastCGI).


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.2.0
======================================================================

* The ability to import demographic data from CSV or other delimited or
  column-formatted data files has been enhanced and several bugs in the
  previous version of this facility have been fixed. A name can now be
  assigned to each source of data to be imported, and if the "Local ID"
  field is assigned, this is assumed to be a unique key which can be used
  to update records that have already been imported. This means that updated
  versions of an imported demographic data can be re-imported and the changes
  in that updated file will be applied to existing records, rather than a
  duplicate set of records being created. Demographic data 
  imported from external sources is marked as read-only, although users
  can "take ownership" of such records if they need to make changes in
  NetEpi (and such changes will not be over-written by future data imports
  from that data source). The use-case (motivation) for this enhancement
  is the need to be able to repeatedly import batches of demographic data 
  from sources such as aircraft passenger manifest files, or from Disaster 
  Victim Registration (DVR) databases, which are often operated by Police or 
  other agencies in disaster and emergency situations. Note that deletion of
  imported records which have disappeared from subsequent import data files
  does not occur (this may be added in a future version).
  
* The batch duplicate person/case/contact detection facility has been made more
  robust and now runs on demand "in the background", rather than interactively,
  and the results of the last batch run of the duplicate detector are
  displayed. This means that the duplicate detection system is now able to deal
  with tens or hundreds of thousands of records if necessary. 

* Installation options were added to allow customised login page and banner
  logos to be used.

* The installer is now smarter and doesn't reset previously specified options
  (with a few exceptions - see the installation notes later in this file).
  This makes the installation of upgrades and bug-fixes easier and less error-
  prone.

* The administrator interface for configuring demographic fields has been
  improved, making it much quicker to use.

* The tabbed interface to demographic fields can be disabled by the system 
  administrator if required - for example, if only a small number of 
  demographic fields have been enabled.

* A few minor and obscure bugs were fixed, including a problem with the 
  pop-up calendar when used with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 web
  browsers.

* A utility has been added to create scatterplot graphs of the RTT (round-trip
  time) performance data collected by NetEpi as it operates. These data give
  an indication of the response times of individual end-users of a NetEpi
  installation. This allows problems with their Internet or other network 
  access to the NetEpi web site to be monitored and addressed pro-actively.
  The script which extracts the RTT data from the web server logs is now 
  smarter and can filter the data in various ways. 

* An example of a separate, simple "labsurv" web application designed to 
  collect weekly, aggregate surveillance data on the numbers and results of
  tests for common respiratory viruses has been included under the labsurv/
  directory of the NetEpi-Collection distribution tarball. Currently, NetEpi
  Collection is designed to collect unit-record data about persons (cases or
  contacts of a disease or syndrome), and although it can be (ab)used to 
  collect aggregate data about "things", it is far from optimal for such 
  purposes. The simple "labsurv" application, which uses the same infra-
  structure as NetEpi Collection (i.e. Python, the Albatross web framework,
  PostgreSQL) has been provided as both a template for similar use-cases else-
  where, and as a test-bed for features and design approaches to be integrated
  into future versions of NetEpi Collection. It should be possible for a
  programmer familiar with Python to customise the labsurv application for
  similar purposes in just a few days. In the future, we hope to provide the
  ability for NetEpi admistrators to be able to  set up similar aggregate 
  and/or "thing"-related (as opposed to person-related) data collection 
  facilities with the usual NetEpi point-and-click interface.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.1.0
======================================================================

The following changes have been made in this version:

* The ability to import demographic data from CSV or other delimited or
  column-formatted data files has been added. A "point-and-click" interface
  to "map" columns in the file to be imported to target demographic
  fields in NetEpi Collection is provided, and a range of 
  transformations of data values can also be specified. Transformed data
  can be previewed before it is imported. The parameters used to import
  a particular data file can be saved and re-used on subsequent occasions.
  
* Several new fields were added to the core "demographics" fields:

  - a third set of address fields, so there are now address fields 
    for residential address, an alternate address, and a work or 
    school address (although the field labels on all of these can
    be customised as previously, so they can be used for other types
    of addresses). [1]

  - a Country field has been added to each of the three sets of address
    fields.

  - an Occupation field was added, grouped with the Work/School address
    fields. [2]

  - a second set of Passport Number and Passport Country fields were 
    added to accommodate people with dual nationality. The default
    label on the Passport Country fields was changed to "Passport
    country/Nationality".

  - fields to capture the name and contact details of the notifier of a
    case or contact were added (these details are associated with the
    case or contact and are thus stored on the underlying CASES table)

  - an "Other Information" text box field was added to record other,
    miscellaneous information about each person.

  As previously, all of these fields and the other demographics fields
  are configurable, and can be hidden or disable or set to appear in 
  only certain parts of the application.

* In order to better accommodate the increased number of demographics
  core fields, a "tabbed" display for some of these fields has
  been provided, which helps to avoid the need for too much vertical
  scrolling. The tabbed field display is also provided on the search
  parameter pages.

* Two new data collection "input" types were added: a pull-down list
  input for "Countries", which lists all current countries, and an equivalent
  one for "Languages", which lists major languages.

* Disabled input boxes are no longer used for the "read-only" display of
  demographic data in certain places in the application; instead, an
  easier-to-read and more compact format is used.

* Searching for existing cases and contacts has been improved by providing
  given name and nickname substitution when the "Phonetic" box is checked: 
  for example, a search for "Tim" will also find "Timothy" and a search
  for "Margaret" will find "Peggy" and so on.

* The duplicate person matching algorithm has been improved (it now uses
  trigrams instead of bigrams) and has been made faster.

* Case and contact details are now colour-coded on the search results
  pages in order to make visual scanning and parsing of the results easier.

* "<<Back" buttons have been added to the top (in addition tot he foot) of
  most pages.

* The display of available contact definitions on the case contacts page
  has been made consistent with the way in which case and contact definitions
  are displayed on the home page.

* The page is now scrolled down to any "Unsaved changes" warning messages
  to avoid any confusion on long pages.

* An "login_helpdesk_contact" configuration option has been added. The
  option specifies an contact message that is used on the login and
  new-user registration pages. This allows an alternate message to be
  specified in these (potentially) less secure contexts.

* Several other minor cosmetic and layout improvements have been made.

* Several bug fixes and some refactoring to improve the robustness and 
  maintainability of the program code.

[1] We know that an unlimited number of addresses, including a complete
address history, should ideally be stored in a separate ADDRESS table,
but that requires fairly major refactoring of core parts of the application
and will have to wait until version 2. The current arrangements seem to be
adequate in the meantime (and changes to addresses are captured in the
audit logs, although we understand that that is not a substitute for a
full address history).

[2] The Occupation column was added to the PERSONS table, for reasons
of expedience. Ideally, it should be on the CASES table and reside 
with other CASE data (as should some addresses and other data current stored
in the PERSONS table). These structural changes are planned for version 2,
but in the meantime, the current arrangements are unlikely to cause major 
problems with most acute outbreak investigations or other relatively short-
term epidemiological data collections, although we recognise that the current
data model is not ideal for use by, say, a chronic disease registry.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.0 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.0.4
===============================================================

The following changes have been made in this version:

* The login page has been re-styled to be rather more attractive.

* The previously separate administration application has been merged into
  the main end-user application. Now there is only one URL for each NetEpi
  Collection instance, and if a logged-in user has administrator rights,
  then an additional menu item appears which allows them to access the
  administration functions that were previously accessible only from a
  separate admin URL. Apart from making things easier for administrators,
  this change has enabled a reduction in otherwise duplicated code - thus
  the total line count for the project has gone down substantially.

* An internal "notification" mechanism has been added so that changes made in
  the administration interface are immediately reflected in all sessions for
  that NetEpi instance. Previously, due to caching, administrative changes
  took up to ten minutes to propagate through to all user sessions, which
  could be confusing for users and administrators alike. See also the notes
  below on "Stand-alone Notification Daemon" regarding the need to disable
  this facility in certain unusual server configurations.

* Administrators can now specify the order in which syndromes/case/contact
  definitions are listed on the home page.

* Each instance of a data collection form is now assigned a unique ID,
  which incorporates a check-digit, and this ID number is shown on screen
  and appears in print-outs of forms and in data export files.

* Users can specify a form instance ID number in the search page, and if it
  is a valid form ID number and the user has permission to access that case
  or contact, the form editing page for that form instance (and thus for
  the correct person and case or contact record) will be displayed immediately.

* A simple "epi curve" charting facility has been added to the built-in
  reports. An "epi curve" is a frequency histogram by onset date (reporting
  date can also be be chosen, or dual charts for both can be drawn). Various
  date and time "binning" options are provided to control the degree of
  temporal aggregation on the x-axis. Further features will be added to
  this chart in later releases, and other built-in charts and graphs will
  be added.  See also the additional installation prerequisites listed below
  which relate to this new feature.

* The search parameters which a user enters are now shown on all search results
  pages. This is particularly important when adding a new case or contact,
  because these search parameters provide context to the "Create a new case"
  or "Create a new contact" buttons.

* Users with "task queue admin" rights can now set up task queues specific to
  their unit (or shared with other units or specific users) without needing
  to ask a central administrator to do it for them.

* Administrators can see summary statistics about the tasks allocated to each
  task queue.

* The refresh button on the end-user task listing page has been removed
  (provided that Javascript is available and enabled in the user's browser).

* Task filtering and display parameters for each user are automatically
  restored and saved each time a user visits the task list page.

* Built-in reporting parameters for each user are automatically restored
  and saved, on a per case/contact definition basis, each time a user visits
  the built-in reports facility.

* User accounts are now only logically deleted, thus preserving entries
  in the audit trail relating to deleted users. User accounts can also be
  easily undeleted. The enabled/disabled user flag remains, unchanged, so
  that user accounts can still be temporally disabled if necessary, and self-
  registered user accounts are still created with the disabled flag set and
  need to be deliberately enabled by an administrator.

* Additional checks are now made before a unit can be deleted, and units with
  enabled users assigned to them can't be deleted. Previously, if units with
  active users were deleted, the users could be left with no unit membership,
  which prevented them from logging in.

* Deleting work queues is now possible. Database integrity constraints 
  previously prevented this except in the case of work queues that had never
  had any tasks associated with them. Work queues can now be deleted (after
  confirmation), provided that all associated tasks have been completed.

* Previously, there were a number of places in the application in which 
  administrators could accidentally exit an admin page without being warned
  they had unsaved changes. This has now been addressed.

* More useful configuration and debug information is included in tracebacks
  if an application exception occurs.

* Authenticated user id, unit id and the NetEpi instance name are now included
  in the RTT (round-trip-time) "perceived performance" data written to the
  web server log for each user interaction. This makes identification of
  network performance issues affecting individual users or groups of users
  at a particular location much easier.

* After much experimentation, problems with unexpected behavior when using
  the browser back buttons on the Opera and Konqueror web browsers have now
  been addressed. The browser back button now behaves as expected (that is,
  the same way that it behaves when Gecko-based browsers such as Mozilla and
  Firefox, or Microsoft Internet Explorer version 6 or 7 are used). In the
  Safari browser, the  browser back button is now effectively disabled when
  accessing NetEpi. This is an improvement on the unexpected behaviour of the
  browser back button in Safari browser when accessing previous versions of
  NetEpi. It should be noted that many web applications have major difficulties
  with the non-standard behaviour of the browser back button in the Safari
  browser (and possibly in the related WebKit browser engine). Of course,
  Safari users can still use the "<<Back" buttons provided in the NetEpi
  application: these work exactly as expected in Safari and in all other
  Web browsers.

* Numerous minor bug fixes and other minor cosmetic adjustments have been
  made.

* Updates to technical and system documentation.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.4 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.0.3
===============================================================

Version 1.0.4 provides the ability to set the preferred date input and
output format on an instance-wide basis, and/or by individual users. Three
date formats can be specified: DMY (DD/MM/YYYY format), MDY (MM/DD/YYYY
format) or ISO (YYYY-MM-DD format). All dates and date/time values are
stored in the database in a format-neutral manner, thus there is no
problem if different users of the same NetEpi database instance use
different preferences for the date format, and individual users can
change their preferred date format on-the-fly without problems.

This feature, together with customisable state/territory/region fields
introduced in Version 1.0.3 and the ability to customise the labels of the
demographic fields added to Version 0.94, should allow NetEpi Collection
to be more easily adapted for use in English-speaking locales outside
Australia. A fully internationalised version accommodating non-English
locales is possible but collaborators are required - the current NetEpi
team cannot create such a fully-internationalised version without
assistance, although they would very much like to do so.

Additionally, Version 1.0.4 fixes several minor bugs - a list of
fixes can be found in the doc/CHANGELOG file. Support for a new
Python-to-PostgreSQL adaptor being developed by Object Craft Pty Ltd
(http://www.object-craft.com.au) has been added. The free, open-source
Object Craft adaptor is still be tested but when released, NetEpi
Collection installations running Version 1.0.4 or later will automatically
make use of it if it is installed.  The release of the Object Craft
Python-to-PostgreSQL adaptor, which promises to be considerably faster
than existing Python-to-PostgreSQL adaptors, will be announced on the
netepi-discuss mailing list as well as elsewhere.

Finally, a PDF version of a presentation on NetEpi Collection and
NetEpi Analysis, given at the School of Information Technologies
at the University of Sydney in June 2007 has been included in
documentation section of the NetEpi page on SourceForge - see
http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=123700


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.3 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.0.2
===============================================================

Version 1.0.3 provides the ability to customise the list of geographical
states, territories and regions in the address part of the demographics
section.  The global list of states and territories for an entire instance
of NetEpi Collection can be customised, and this can be further customised
on a per-syndrome or per-case-definition basis if required. The customised
lists of states and territories are automatically taken into account
when performing general searches.

Additionally, Version 1.0.3 fixes a small number of minor but annoying
bugs - a list of fixes can be found in the doc/CHANGELOG file. Special
thanks to Stefan Stirzaker, Office of Health Protection, Surveillance
Branch, Surveillance Policy & Systems Section, Population Health Division,
Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, for reporting
the bugs in question.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2 RELATIVE TO VERSION 1.0beta
===============================================================

This is a bug-fix release only, no new features or facilities have
been added.  A list of fixes and other minor cosmetic changes can be
found in the doc/CHANGELOG file.

Special thanks to Francois Marsan for finding and carefully reporting a
number of obscure and not-so-obscure bugs that had eluded us.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0beta RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.99
==============================================================

The major addition to Version 1.0beta is the inclusion of a comprehensive
record merging facility. This provides a mechanism to identify potentially
duplicated PERSON records (using a bigram-based fuzzy matching algorithm,
although arbitrary pairs of records can also be merged), and the user can
then selectively merge demographic details and associated case, contact
and task records, for each pair of duplicated person records. This may
result in duplicated case or contact records for the resulting "merged"
person, so there is an additional facility which can be used to merge
case or contact records for a given person. Similarly for each case or
contact record, there is a facility to merge data form records of the
same type. In these merge facilities, each of which can be accessed
independently of the others, the user can select whether to retain
data from "record A" or "record B", on a data-item-by-data-item basis,
or may chose to include information from both A and B records and edit
the resulting combined data field.  Much effort was put into designing a
simple user interface to these merge facilities which make the complex
merging task as quick and easy as possible for the end user. Unlike
deletions, merges of records cannot be undone, but full details of
all merge actions are captured in the audit trail log, allowing manual
separation of merged records if required subsequently.

Another major change in this version is the renaming of the application
from "NetEpi Case Manager" to "NetEpi Collection", which better reflects
the fairly generic role it plays, while also sounding less clinical.

Other significant enhancements to Version 1.0beta include:

* Provision of a read-only mode, in which the privileges of selected 
  users can be restricted so that they can only view data, but not
  edit or delete it. The usual fine-grained access control mechanisms 
  still apply to such read-only users.
* Pull-down menus have replaced a plethora of buttons on the case 
  and contact editing pages. The result is a cleaner look with no loss
  in usability (we feel, feedback welcome).
* Labelling of cases versus contacts has been made smarter in order to
  reduce the occasional semantic confusion that was evident in parts 
  of the application.
* On certain pages more contextual information with respect to the 
  current user or current case or contact has been provided to assist
  users in regaining their "bearings" after being interrupted while using
  the system.
* Visual feedback is now provided each time a record of any type is updated.
* Most error messages and warnings now appear at the top of the page, 
  where they are harder to overlook.
* Access to the built-in line-listing/reports facility is now restricted
  to those users who have been granted the "bulk export" privilege.
* The "Next" button on search pages is now the default, so that the 
  Enter key can be used to cause a search to be performed (thus
  improving end user ergonomics).
* The "round-trip-time" facility, which measures and captures the 
  response time (including network-related delays and latency) of NetEpi 
  from the point-of-view of the end user, has been enhanced to work
  correctly when the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser is used, and now
  also records a timestamp for each response time captured in the web server
  log. Utilities to extract these response times from the web server log 
  for analysis and presentation in statistical or other visualisation 
  packages have also been added, including a script to import the data
  into NetEpi Analysis.
* Another utility, called "httpinteract", has been included. It is
  a simple tool which can be used to acquire time-series data about
  network performance from end-user's workstations or access points.
  We have found it useful in pinpointing when and where network bandwidth,
  latency or congestion may be inadequate for satisfactory use of NetEpi,
  so that appropriate remedial action can be taken - such network problems
  can almost always be solved.
* The deletion status of records is clearly shown when they are printed
  out.
* Facilities to browse all cases for a given person, and to jump directly
  to the parent case of a contact, were added.
* Unit tests and some Selenium functional tests were updated to work
  correctly with the current version.
* System documentation was brought up-to-date.

Finally, a lot of work has also gone into the creation of a "live CD"
for demonstration purposes. This "live CD", which is based on the popular
Ubuntu Linux distribution, allows most recent (that is, less than four
or five years old) desktop or laptop computers to be booted directly
from the live CD into a cut-down version of Ubuntu Linux, with a full,
working copy of NetEpi Collection installed and ready to use. Data can be
stored between sessions on a USB memory stick or external hard drive. No
software or files are actually installed on the host computer - it runs
entirely from the CD-ROM. The demonstration system includes a full Web
server and can thus be accessed over a network by multiple users, as well
as locally.  Introductory "screencasts" and other background material will
be included on the final NetEpi live CD. However, at this stage the live
CD is still undergoing testing, but we have included the scripts needed
to build the live CD in the NetEpi Collection distribution tarball for
those who wish to create their own customised version. However, these
scripts are complex and dangerous, and should only be run and modified
by experienced system administrators and developers who know exactly
what they are doing. They are only needed to create new versions of a
live CD and should be completely ignored by NetEpi users and most system
administrators. An .iso file of a demo live CD will be made available
for download (and then burning onto a CD-ROM) at the time of the final
release of Version 1.0.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.98
===========================================================

Apart from several minor bug fixes, some general cleaning up of the code
base and some additional unit tests, the very big addition to Version
0.99 is a built-in "line-listing" reporting facility.

This facility allows tabular "line-listing" reports to be produced
through a simple and easy-to-use interface. Filters and sorting orders 
based on demographic data and on data items contained in syndrome/case
definition-specific forms can be defined, and the resulting record sets 
appear in the report or can be used as a "browse list" to page through
case or contact records in the edit screens, one at a time. Summary 
or user-selectable fields (columns) from forms can also be included
in the reports.

The (still experimental) case-to-contact relationship visualisation tool 
has also been integrated into the reporting framework to take advantage
of the filtering facilities it provides.

Report definitions (including the filtering parameters) can be saved
for re-use later, and these saved report definitions can be shared 
with other members of the user's business unit or with all users 
on the system.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.98 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.97
===========================================================

Version 0.98 brings the following (in no particular order): 

* A (global) count of active cases of each syndrome is now
  shown on the home page.

* An indication of number of contacts is now shown on the 
  main case edit page.

* The ability to examine the details of users in each
  business unit from task assignment and ACL (access control
  list) pages.

* All current and enabled syndromes/case definitions are now
  shown on the main page, not just those the unit (or rather
  users in that unit) has access to, but the "add" button is
  suppressed if the unit does not have edit rights for that 
  syndrome/case definition.

* A facility to allow NetEpi administrators to "clear" a 
  syndrome/case definition of data - this deletes all cases,
  contacts, form instances (but not form definitions!) and
  tasks associated with a syndrome/case definition (without
  deleting the syndrome/case definition itself). This is very
  useful for clearing out training or test data from a 
  syndrome/case definition prior to "production" or real-life
  use. An additional confirmation was added because this 
  facility permanently deletes data.

* A facility by which a NetEpi administrator can use the web 
  interface to permanently delete a syndrome/case definition
  and all associated cases, forms, tasks and log entries. This
  allows redundant, obsolete or test/dummy syndromes/case
  definitions to be removed from an existing NetEpi instance,
  or for a NetEpi instance to be cloned (using PostgreSQL 
  database back-up and restore utilities) and then unwanted 
  syndromes/case definitions removed. An additional confirmation
  was added because this facility permanently deletes data.

* No longer indicate nature of login failures to improve
  security.

* Add additional demographic fields for one extra set of 
  alternative address and other contact information (which
  can be relabelled for each case definition/syndrome)
 
* Improvements to form definition importing (form definition
  import name matching a little smarter, make form import seed
  the "forms" table if necessary).

* A new command line facility to import and export form definitions
  in batches from a Collection instance.

* "Onset date" and "Notification date" error messages now
  honour syndrome-specific labelling for these fields.

* The ability to view logs associated with a contact.

* The main application structure graph was updated, and an admin
  application structure graph was added.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.97 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.96
===========================================================

The major additions to Version 0.97 are: 

* Ability to add a contact record and post-hoc associate it with 
  a case, and/or dissociate it from a case and re-assign to a different
  case, and handle the merging of ACL (access rights) necessitated
  by such changes.
* Improvements to the form data roll-forward facility so that 
  incompatible changes to form filed data types that would lead
  to data loss or truncation can be readily identified and corrected.
* Ability to print the data associated with a case or contact as a
  "report" (rather like a set a already-filled-in forms)
* Ability to optionally include or exclude deleted records from 
  data exports
* Restriction of ability to export data to only some users who 
  have been explicitly granted the right to do so.
* Improvements to the information captured in the audit log,
  particularly with respect to contact records and their association
  with case records.
* Require confirmation when undeleting cases or contacts.
* Require confirmation needed when deleting a user in the admin
  application.
* Fixed bug when a users from a disabled unit tried to log in.
* Simplification of conditional question skip/enable subsystem.
* Additional guards against inadvertent failure to save changes in 
  admin interface

In addition, numerous minor cosmetic changes and bug fixes have been 
implemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.96 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.95
===========================================================

The major addition to Version 0.96 is a conditional form input skip/enable
feature, which allows parts of questions, whole questions or multiple
questions on a form to be selectively enabled or disabled based on
categorical data elsewhere on the same form. Skip instructions are
automatically generated for printed forms or where Javascript is
unavailable or disabled.

A large improvement to usability is also provided by some clever
JavaScript which captures the "Back" button on the user's browser and
makes it behave like the "<<Back"" navigation buttons in the application
itself. This effectively removes a major source of user frustration by
avoiding browser-generated "re-post" dialogue boxes appearing on screen.

In addition, a large number of bug fixes have been made and the interface
to parts of the admin application has been made more consistent and
foolproof - it is now very hard to inadvertently forget to save changes
made in the admin application. Also, the question editor pages in the
admin form definition editor facility has been revised.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.95 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.94
===========================================================

The major addition to Version 0.95 is a simple (but we hope effective)
workflow subsystem, which allows "tasks", such as completing a case or
contact follow-up form, to be assigned to individual users, business
units or arbitrary "task queues" to which users and business units can
be subscribed.  These tasks can be scheduled for immediate or delayed
attention, and users have access to a list of tasks assigned to them
or otherwise available to them through their membership of a business
unit or subscription to a task queue.  Clicking on an assigned task
automatically loads the correct case or contact record and opens the
correct data form to be completed. Additional instructions can be added
to tasks if necessary.

This subsystem is intended to allow tasks generated by a large number
of cases or contacts of cases of, say, a novel strain of influenza to
be distributed to many workers located in many business units across
the health system. It should also be useful for many other purposes,
including reminders to oneself to follow-up missing data or check
responses and so on.

Other features added to Version 0.95 include better visual feedback when
data in forms is updated, better indication of the deletion status of
records, improvements to the form editor, and various minor cosmetic
and labelling improvements.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN VERSION 0.94 RELATIVE TO VERSION 0.90
===========================================================

Following is a summary, in no particular order, of the major changes 
visible to or of relevance to end-users and/or administrators, in 
NetEpi Collection Version 0.94, relative to NetEpi Collection
Version 0.90 which was released in June 2005. Note that Versions 0.91
and 0.92 were intermediate versions which were not released publicly
and Version 0.93 was quickly superseded by Version 0.94.

In addition, there has been considerable refactoring and general tidying-up
of the underlying programme code, as well as several bug fixes and security
improvements. 

 * Problem with download of exported data files via Microsoft Internet
   Explorer fixed.

 * Added a new class of user (called "unit admins") who can administer
   users in their unit via a new page accessible from the end-user (not
   admin) application. This removes a potential bottleneck of admins
   having to remotely vet and approve large numbers of new user accounts
   in a short time during an emergency.

 * Added JavaScript to track and report client's submit RTT
   (round-trip-time), added code to Request object to log reported
   RTT. This allows the total response time, as perceived by the end
   user, to be monitored centrally - in particular, problems related to
   network congestion can be detected, as well as problems due excessive
   server load.

 * Added the ability to print selectable sets of blank forms, on
   a per-syndrome basis, for use if the system is off-line, down or
   otherwise unavailable.

 * Ability to add certain rights to groups of users, and also ability
   to add certain rights to individual users. These include the right
   to see or edit all records.

 * Version information added to login screens to help avoid confusion
   during support calls.

 * Ability to save user preferences, including preferences for phonetic
   searching, results per page and pop-up calendars (see below).

 * Added client-side sorting of various tables in the admin application.

 * JavaScript used to to scroll to first error in forms.

 * Form definitions are now stored in XML form in the main database, not
   as Python files in the Web server file system. This improves security
   and makes it much easier to back-up the entire state of the system,
   without having to interrupt use of the system in any way.

 * Added ability to export and import form definitions in XML form, which
   lays the foundations for a shared and/or distributed form definition
   "library".

 * Form inputs that are required (mandatory) are now visually identified.

 * Added "definition last updated" and other useful metadata to form
   definitions.

 * Merge demogfields-branch

 * Added additional demographic/ID fields: mobile_phone, fax_phone,
   e_mail, passport_number and passport_country, interpreter
   required/language, to make the system better suited for use in border
   screening at airports etc.

 * Added ability to relabel or hide demographic/ID fields on a
   per-syndrome basis.

 * Added per-syndrome case status field, renamed field to just "status".

 * Storage of case and contact data unified. This allows a great deal
   more flexibility, including the ability to specify multiple "contact
   syndromes" for different types of contacts of cases.

 * Added interactive pop-up date entry widget (calendar).

 * Allowed allow a person to be contact of a case for more than one
   contact syndrome; included contact type in search results; revised
   styling of search results for cases and contacts to make them slightly
   clearer.

 * Simplified application navigation slightly (removed user details
   link from page banner, use tools instead), carry more context across
   new/edit/search screens.

 * Added paging to contacts list to allow cases with large numbers of
   contacts to be more easily managed.

 * Added experimental Case/Contact relationship visualisation using
   GraphViz.

 * Changes to allow PostgreSQL versions 8.0 and 8.1 to be used, as well
   as versions 7.3 and 7.4 as supported previously.

 * Deleting/hiding of cases and contacts now fully implemented.

 * Major speed improvements to phonetic searches.

 * Updated Collection-ER documentation to reflect schema changes.

 * Added a confirmation dialog when admins enable a user, to ensure that
   they have checked the new user's bona fides.

 * Add logging of case access (ACL) control changes.

 * Added support for use of Trac-style wiki mark-up for text used in
   various places in the application (see doc/NetEpi_wiki_markup.html ).
